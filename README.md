ğŸ“« How to reach me: negin.mgdm@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact: As a holder of a Chemistry degree, I embarked on a unique trajectory and delved into the world of programming. Now, I bring the precision of a chemist to the art of coding, working as a passionate software engineer. My journey is a blend of atoms and algorithms! ğŸ’»ğŸ”¬
